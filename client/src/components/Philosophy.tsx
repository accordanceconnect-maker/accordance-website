          Structure is not an aesthetic choice. It is the mechanism by which
          uncertainty is reduced before capital, reputation, or time is deployed.

          Our work centers on decisions with lasting consequence. We apply
          statutory precision and disciplined execution, so that when a mandate
          advances, its implications are understood and its trade-offs are
          consciously accepted.
