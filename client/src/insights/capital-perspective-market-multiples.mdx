## Market multiples are comforting.

Market multiples are comforting.  
They give decision-makers a sense of validation, a benchmark, and an easy explanation for why a location, asset, or expansion “makes sense.”

In India’s real estate-led expansions, particularly across Delhi-NCR, multiples are frequently used to accelerate decisions rather than test them.

The problem is not that multiples are wrong.  
The problem is that they are often applied where capital discipline should be doing the work.

## Structural Reality

Market multiples are comparative tools, not decision tools.

In real estate-linked expansion, they are typically borrowed from:

- Recent transactions
- Peer expansions
- Developer narratives
- Industry chatter masquerading as data

Structurally, three things happen:

**First, multiples flatten context.**  

They ignore differences in lease rigidity, regulatory exposure, exit liquidity, and tax behaviour.

**Second, multiples reward momentum, not resilience.**  

Assets in hot corridors look attractive precisely when risk concentration is highest.

**Third, multiples travel faster than fundamentals.**  

They spread before zoning clarity, statutory risk, or absorption reality is understood.

Expansion begins optimising optics instead of outcomes.

## The Overlooked Factor

What is consistently missed is capital friction.

Capital friction appears as:

- Approval delays
- Cash lock-in
- GST inefficiencies
- Exit discounts

In Delhi-NCR, we routinely see expansions that passed “paper tests” but failed return thresholds once friction was applied honestly.

Multiples never ask the uncomfortable question:

**How efficiently does capital enter, operate, and exit this asset?**

## Strategic Implication

When expansion is driven by market multiples, four outcomes follow:

- Overpayment disguised as strategic entry  
- Margin compression mistaken for scale advantage  
- Capital trapped in slow-moving assets  
- Exit flexibility quietly destroyed  

Capital discipline does not slow expansion.  
It prevents irreversible expansion mistakes.

## Advisory Relevance

A capital-first advisory lens changes the sequence:

- Expansion & Asset Deployment: Capital behaviour first, pricing second  
- Capital Perspective: Entry realism before commitment  
- Market Entry Advisory: Preserve flexibility  
- Regulatory Clarity: Timeline risk built into capital modelling  

Multiples are not rejected.  
They are demoted to their correct role.

## Closing Perspective

Market multiples are useful indicators.  
They are poor decision-makers.

Strong expansions align with capital reality, not market enthusiasm.
